## What I Believe

First and foremost, while any given class has its particular body of content to be covered,
teaching and learning are fundamentally **relational activities**. There are three primary categories of
relationships in a classroom:

- The relationship between students and me.
- The relationship between students and each other.
- The relationship between students and the objects (e.g., computers) and activities they engage with during their learning process.

## How I Teach

My students are people who are learning to code. Learning to code is,
in my view, an endeavor that is most similar to some combination of **learning a foreign language** and
**learning to play an instrument**. It shares both cognitive and socio-emotional features of these other long-term processes, and programming students are most successful when they establish the kind of **habits** that also lead to success for musicians and human-language learners.

What are those habits? In my view and in my experience, here are the most important ones:

### Practice early, practice often.

### Build skills by doing, not just by watching.

### Get enough sleep.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best debugger ever made is a good night&#39;s sleep.<br />&mdash; Sasha Laundy (@SashaLaundy) <a href="https://twitter.com/SashaLaundy/status/936661004137635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

Get enough sleep. Seriously. 

### Write things down.

### Get comfortable making mistakes.

As my youth orchestra director once said:<br />
_"If you are going to play a wrong note, play it loud."_

### Don't panic.

And don't forget your towel.

## What Students Say

I am proud of my success as a teacher and the ways I have improved and grown
over time in my career. Here are some of my favorite statements from students,
almost all from anonymous end-of-term evaluations.

- _You are the best CS professor I have ever had._
- _You are hands down the best teacher I have had at Las Positas College._
- _The instructor for this course was probably the best I ever had, I will miss him._
- _I just want you to know that you are a perfect teacher._
- _Thank you for listening, answering, and being respectful. I don't think I can overstate how much I value feeling respected in a classroom._

_**But students say critical things, too, right?**_

Yes, they sometimes do. Different students like different kinds of teachers, my personality is a better match
for some people than others, and there are areas I am still working on and developing as an instructor.
More about that in a future update to this page.
