# What I Believe

First and foremost, while any given class has its particular body of content to be covered,
teaching and learning are fundamentally **relational activities**. There are three primary categories of
relationships in a classroom:

- The relationship between students and me.
- The relationship between students and each other.
- The relationship between students and the objects (e.g., computers) and activities they engage with during their learning process.

# How I Teach

My students are people who are learning to code. Learning to code is,
in my view, an endeavor that is most similar to some combination of **learning a foreign language** and
**learning to play an instrument**. It shares both cognitive and socio-emotional features of these other long-term processes, and programming students are most successful when they establish the kind of **habits** that also lead to success for musicians and human-language learners.

What are those habits? In my view and in my experience, here are the most important ones:

## Practice early, practice often.

One big part of learning to code is not about what you think or understand in your mind, but is about 
developing [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory) in your fingers. 

## Build skills by doing, not just by watching.

Nobody could learn to play the piano just by watching someone else do it. You have to actually touch the instrument 
with your own hands. Even if -- especially if! -- your fingers don't quite know what they are doing yet. 

## Get enough sleep.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best debugger ever made is a good night&#39;s sleep.<br />&mdash; Sasha Laundy (@SashaLaundy) <a href="https://twitter.com/SashaLaundy/status/936661004137635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

Get enough sleep. Seriously.

If you aren't getting enough sleep because you are staying up late to finish a CS assignment, please understand
that means that you are **doing it wrong**. You have bad, counterproductive work habits. You are putting yourself
in the position of coding while being in the **worst possible** state for good coding. Don't do this!

If you have this problem, there is a simple solution, but it requires some intention and some control over your own
thoughts. But I guarantee it will make a huge (huge!) difference. Here it is: **Pretend your assignment is due
TWO DAYS earlier than it actually is.** 

## Write things down.

Typing and writing are different actions. Actually **write** things down! Also **draw** pictures and diagrams. If it helps, make clay models. Or build with Legos. Or do interpretive dance. Or act things out. The more different ways you can connect to the concepts and patterns you need to practice, the better!

## Get comfortable making mistakes.

As my youth orchestra director once said:<br />
_"If you are going to play a wrong note, play it loud."_

And you **will** play (metaphorical) wrong notes. Lots of them.

**Debugging** code is as much a part of creating software as
writing code in the first place. Get used to it. Make mistakes proudly, knowing that writing broken code
and then figuring out how to fix it completely normal.
You aren't alone, and doing things that don't work the first time (or second or third or fourth time!) 
is essential to the process of building your skills.

## Don't panic.

And don't forget your towel.

# What Students Say

I am proud of my success as a teacher and the ways I have improved and grown
over time in my career. Here are some of my favorite statements from students,
almost all from anonymous end-of-term evaluations.

- _You are the best CS professor I have ever had._
- _You are hands down the best teacher I have had at Las Positas College._
- _The instructor for this course was probably the best I ever had, I will miss him._
- _I just want you to know that you are a perfect teacher._
- _Thank you for listening, answering, and being respectful. I don't think I can overstate how much I value feeling respected in a classroom._

_**But students say critical things, too, right?**_ Yes, they sometimes do. Different students like different kinds of teachers, my personality is a better match
for some people than others, and there are areas I am still working on and developing as an instructor.
More about that in a future update to this page.
