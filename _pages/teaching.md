## What I Believe

First and foremost, while any given class has its particular body of content to be covered,
teaching and learning are fundamentally **relational activities**. There are three primary categories of
relationships in a classroom:

- The relationship between students and me.
- The relationship between students and each other.
- The relationship between students and the objects (e.g., computers) and activities they engage with during their learning process.

## How I Teach

My students are people who are learning to code. Learning to code is,
in my view, an endeavor that is most similar to some combination of **learning a foreign language** and
**learning to play an instrument**. It shares both cognitive and socio-emotional features of these other long-term processes, and programming students are most successful when they establish the kind of **habits** that also lead to success for musicians and (human) language learners.

## What Students Say

I am proud of my success as a teacher and the ways I have improved and grown
over time in my career. Here are some of my favorite statements from students,
almost all from anonymous end-of-term evaluations.

* _You are the best CS professor I have ever had._
* _You are hands down the best teacher I have had at Las Positas College._
* _The instructor for this course was probably the best I ever had, I will miss him._
* _I just want you to know that you are a perfect teacher._
* _Thank you for listening, answering, and being respectful. I don't think I can overstate how much I value feeling respected in a classroom._
