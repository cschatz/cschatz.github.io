# What I Believe

First and foremost, while any given class has its particular body of content to be covered,
teaching and learning are fundamentally **relational activities**.

# How I Teach

My students are people who are learning to code. Learning to code is,
in my view, an equal mixture of **learning a foreign language** and
**learning to play an instrument**, and programming students are most
successful when they have the corresponding habits.

# What Students Say

I am proud of my success as a teacher and the ways I have improved and grown
over time in my career. Here are some of my favorite statements from students,
almost all from anonymous end-of-term evaluations.

* You are the best CS professor I have ever had.
* You are hands down the best teacher I have had at Las Positas College.
* The instructor for this course was probably the best I ever had, I will miss him.
* I just want you to know that you are a perfect teacher.
* Thank you for listening, answering, and being respectful. I don't think I can overstate how much I value feeling respected in a classroom.
